 Return to Gatlinburg from Cherokee Orchard
 I’d recommend, if you have the time, to take the Roarking Fork Motor Nature Trail by car (not RV, bus, or any other large vehicle). It’s extremely pretty in mid-April.

 If heading east on I-40, you could drive Hwy 321 east of Gatlinburg to Cosby, take a left then a right onto the Foothills Parkway to I-40. If heading west on I-40, probably easiest to get on 321 back in Gatlinburg towards the Parkway (also Hwy 441) northbound to Pigeon Forge and then Sevierville. Follow signs to I-40.
